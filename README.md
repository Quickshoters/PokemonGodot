# Project-PokemonGodot
A work in progress re-implementation of the game Pokemon Uranium in the Godot Engine.
This project will only contain the Godot project and its source code. All game assets must be obtained from the original game. 
Discord Server is up! Feel free to ask anything! https://discord.gg/Ay3c3gg

Please note that this game is neither developed by, nor endorsed by Nintendo, Game Freak, and The Pokémon Company.

# Why am I doing this?
Pokémon Essentials on the RPG Maker XP game engine. This remake project uses Godot, an modern game engine that is free and open source. Using Godot has several major advantages over RPG Maker XP. 

Godot is cross platform which means it can run on many different platforms natively such as Windows, MacOS (Both intel and M1 based), Linux, *BSD, Android, iOS, and even on web browsers. 
RPG Maker XP is just limited to Windows and requires 3rd party efforts such as wine and joiplay to run on other platforms suboptimally. This project aims to support as many platforms that Godot supports.

# Current progress
Only a limited portion of the game is playable currently.
